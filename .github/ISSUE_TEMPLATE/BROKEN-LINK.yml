        ### Links HOWTO
        
        To report and fix any links, do so in the following format:

        ```md
        - [link label](https://link_content.com){:target="_blank"}
        ```

        If you want to fix multiple links, just write them one under the other:

        ```md
        - [link label1](https://link_content1.com){:target="_blank"}
        - [link label2](https://link_content2.com){:target="_blank"}
        ```
  - type: dropdown
    id: section
    attributes:
      label: Section where the link is located
      description: Under what website section is this link, so we can find it and fix it
